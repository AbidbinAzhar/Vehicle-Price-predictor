# Vehicle-Price-predictor
Situation: Developed a Used Vehicle Price Recommender as a part of my academic coursework.

1. My task was to develop reliable prediction model involving data cleaning, feature selection, model building, and evaluation, followed by presenting the findings.
2. Gathered & Cleaned data by reduced missing values by 85% through data cleaning, achieved a 90% improvement in data quality after cleaning procedures. Developed automated scripts saving 20 hours of manual data cleaning, reducing preparation time by 75%.
3. Conducted EDA, Identified kept important 10% features, cutting model complexity training time half, keeping 90% accuracy.
4. Implemented a Linear Regression model using Python reducing assessment time by 80%, Achieved 50% reduction in prediction error through model parameter optimization.
5. Split data into training and testing sets, reducing data leakage and improving model generalization by 10%.
6. The model achieved high accuracy, Reduced error by 55% compared to baseline models using RMSE evaluation.
